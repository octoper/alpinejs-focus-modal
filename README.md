# AlpineJS Focus Modal

This AlpineJS plugin helps with focus-trap problems of modals.
When you are opening a modal the focus will be moved to the first focusable element and the focus will be trapped into the modal.

## Install

```html
<script src="" defer></script>
```

**From NPM**: Install the package from NPM.
